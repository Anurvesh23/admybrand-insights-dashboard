# AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard

This report details how AI coding assistants were leveraged to build the "ADmyBRAND Insights" analytics dashboard. The primary goal was to maximize development speed while maintaining high code quality and producing a beautiful, modern UI.

---

## AI Tools Used

-   **Primary Assistant:** Google Gemini (for architecture, component generation, logic, and documentation).
-   **UI Component Reference:** The design and structure are heavily inspired by `shadcn/ui`, and AI was prompted to generate components that mimic its style and API.

## Sample Prompts (used with Gemini)

Here are a few examples of prompts that guided the development process.

1.  **High-Level Architecture & Setup:**
    > "I'm building an analytics dashboard called 'ADmyBRAND Insights' using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, served from a single `index.html`. The UI library should be inspired by shadcn/ui. Please outline a complete project structure, including folders for components, data, and libs. Also, list all the necessary CDN links for an `importmap` setup, including a charting library like `recharts` and a table library like `@tanstack/react-table`."

2.  **Complex Component Generation (Data Table):**
    > "Generate a reusable React component for a data table using `@tanstack/react-table` and custom UI components that look like `shadcn/ui`. It needs to be a client component. The table should display a list of recent sales with columns for Customer Name, Email, Status, and Amount. Implement client-side sorting, a search input to filter by customer name, and simple pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons). The 'Status' should be a custom Badge component with different colors for 'Success', 'Pending', and 'Failed'."

3.  **Chart Component Generation & Theming:**
    > "Create a responsive line chart component using `recharts` to display monthly revenue data. The component should be wrapped in a Card component with a title and description. It must use a React Context hook (`useTheme`) to dynamically adjust the color of the axes and tooltip background for both light and dark modes."

## AI vs. Manual Work Split

-   **AI-Generated (Approx. 75%):**
    -   **Initial Project Setup:** The entire file structure, dependency list in the `importmap`, and Tailwind/theming configuration in `index.html` were based on AI output.
    -   **Boilerplate Code:** All component files (`.tsx`), including imports, function definitions, and basic JSX structure, were generated first by the AI.
    -   **Complex Logic:** The implementation logic for the TanStack Table (sorting, filtering, pagination) was almost entirely AI-generated.
    -   **Chart Configurations:** The setup for all three `recharts` charts was generated via prompts.
    -   **Mock Data:** The structure and content of `data/mockData.ts` were generated by AI.
    -   **Documentation:** The initial drafts of the `README.md` and this report were generated by AI.

-   **Manual Coding & Customization (Approx. 25%):**
    -   **Component Integration:** Manually assembling the generated components in `App.tsx` and ensuring the grid layout was responsive and visually balanced.
    -   **Styling & UI Polish:** Fine-tuning Tailwind CSS classes, adjusting component spacing, adding hover effects, and ensuring perfect pixel alignment. While AI provided the base, the final "stunning UI" aspect required manual iteration and a designer's eye.
    -   **Prop-typing and Refinement:** Adjusting TypeScript types and refining component props for better reusability and clarity.
    -   **Debugging:** Investigating and fixing issues, such as chart rendering bugs or component state management quirks, and applying fixes.
    -   **Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively refining prompts to get the desired output from the AI was a significant manual task.
