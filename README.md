## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports `importmap`.

### Running the Application

No build step or installation is required.

1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
2.  **Local Server (Optional):** For development, you can serve the project directory using a simple local server to avoid potential CORS issues with local file access.
    ```bash
    # If you have Python 3 installed
    python -m http.server

    # Or use a tool like 'live-server' for automatic reloading
    npx live-server
    ```
    Then, open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser.
